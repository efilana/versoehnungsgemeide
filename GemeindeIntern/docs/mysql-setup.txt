Brief document on MySQL (MariaDB) setup
=======================================


Connect to MariaDB as superuser:

       # mysql -u root -p

Create database:

       MariaDB [(none)]> create database churchtools;
       Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

Grant usage to new user and create it:

       MariaDB [(none)]> grant usage on *.* to foo@localhost identified by 'bar';
       Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

Grant all privileges to new user:

       MariaDB [(none)]> grant all privileges on churchtools.* to foo@localhost;
       Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)


Edit appropriate configuration files of ChurchTools and enjoy!
